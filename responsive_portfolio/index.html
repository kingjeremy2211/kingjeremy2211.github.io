      <p>My current position is a Machine Operator IIII, which is the highest level possible at my current company.  This means I have been certified to run over 25 machines in the card manufacturing/printing industry.  14 years of learning and training new operators has given me lots to be proud of.</p>

      <p>Ever since I can remember, I've been interested in how things work.  My mom used to find me in my room late at night, dismantling the vcr, tv, or stereo, just to put it back together again.  I quickly earned the nickname "Mr.Fixit".  If anyone in my household, or immediate family, needed something fixed, I was the first one willing and eager to give it my best.</p>

      <p>Nothing has changed since then.  I have learned many skills throughout the years, including:</p>

      <br>
			<ol>
				<li>Auto-Mechanic</li>
				<li>Appliance Repair</li>
				<li>Electronics Repair</li>
				<li>iPhone Repair</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sreen Replacement</li>
							<li>Camera Replacement</li>
							<li>Battery Replacement</li>
							<li>Carrier Unlock</li>
							<li>Software Jailbreak</li>
						</ul>
				<li>Car Audio/Video Install</li>
				<li>Small Engine Repair</li>
				<li>Computer Repairs</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>I can go on and on.  I find the most joy in learning as I work.  This is why I chose to pursue a career in coding/development.  I am excited to be back in a school setting and look forward to continuing my lifelong learning adventure.</p>
